Exoplanets
An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most of them orbit other stars, but some free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, are untethered to any star. We’ve confirmed more than 5,600 exoplanets out of the billions that we believe exist.
Overview
Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) Even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away. We know there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.
By measuring exoplanets’ sizes (diameters) and masses (weights), we can see compositions ranging from rocky (like Earth and Venus) to gas-rich (like Jupiter and Saturn). Some planets may be dominated by water or ice, while others are dominated by iron or carbon. We’ve identified lava worlds covered in molten seas, puffy planets the density of Styrofoam and dense cores of planets still orbiting their stars.
An exoplanet, or extrasolar planet, is a planet outside of our solar system that usually orbits another star in our galaxy.
Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals 5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) That is as far as current telescopes have been able to probe. We know from NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy.
Although exoplanets are far – even the closest known exoplanet to Earth, Proxima Centauri b, is still about 4 light-years away – scientists have discovered creative ways to spot these seemingly tiny objects.
How Do We Find Exoplanets?
There are five methods scientists commonly use to discover exoplanets.
The two main techniques are the transit and radial velocity methods.
When a planet passes directly between an observer and the star it orbits, it blocks some of that starlight. For a brief period of time, that star’s light actually gets dimmer. It's a tiny change, but it's enough to clue astronomers in to the presence of an exoplanet around a distant star. This is known as the transit method.
Orbiting planets cause stars to wobble in space, changing the color of light astronomers see when observing a star. Stars are affected by the gravitational tug of their orbiting planets and, when observed through a telescope, this affects the star's light spectrum. If the star moves in the direction of the observer it will appear to be shifted toward blue. If it is moving away from the observer, it will shift toward the red. Observing this is known as the radial velocity method.
NASA’s Exoplanet Space Telescopes
Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered and confirmed orbiting other stars. The first evidence of exoplanets dates to 1917 when Van Maanen identified the first polluted white dwarf, however, the first confirmed detection of an exoplanet would not come until the 1990s. The discovery of exoplanets grew exponentially in the years to follow with the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The Kepler mission was specifically designed to survey our region of the Milky Way galaxy to discover hundreds of Earth-size and smaller planets in or near the habitable zone (also called the “Godilocks zone,” the area around a star where rocky planets could have liquid water on the surface) and determine the fraction of stars that might have such planets around them. After the second of Kepler’s four gyroscope-like wheels failed in 2013, Kepler completed its prime mission that November and began its extended mission, K2. The spacecraft was retired in 2018, but Kepler data are still being used to find exoplanets (more than 2,700 confirmed so far).
NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope (2013-2020) was not designed to search for exoplanets, but its infrared instruments made it an excellent exoplanet explorer. It was used in the notable discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In 2018 the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was launched as a successor to Kepler to discover exoplanets in orbit around the brightest dwarf stars, the most common star type in our galaxy. NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope and the future Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope hold great promise for what we can learn from exoplanets. Through spectroscopy, reading light signatures for information, astronomers hope to learn more about planet atmospheres and the conditions of the planets themselves.
Confirmed vs. Candidate
An exoplanet candidate is a likely planet discovered by a telescope but has not yet been proven to actually exist.
It is possible for some candidates to turn out to be "false positives." A planet is considered "confirmed" once it is verified through additional observation using two other telescopes. There are currently thousands of planet candidates awaiting confirmation. But time on telescopes is considered a precious resource and it takes a lot of computing time to find which targets to investigate. This is one area where amateur scientists can work with NASA data to help refine targets and even discover exoplanets. Where computers might miss a single transit, humans can detect small brightness dips in data that might tell us there is a planet to be found.
How Do We Name Exoplanets?
Exoplanet names can look long and complicated at first, especially when compared to names like Venus and Mars. However, there is a logic behind their naming system that is important to how scientists catalog thousands of planets. Astronomers differentiate between the alphanumeric "designations" and alphabetical "proper names." All stars and exoplanets have designations, but very few have proper names.
The first part of an exoplanet name is usually the telescope or survey that discovered it. The number is the order in which the star was cataloged by position. The lowercase letter stands for the planet, in the order in which the planet was found. The first planet found is always named b, with ensuing planets named c, d, e, f and so on. The star that the exoplanet orbits is usually the undeclared "A" of the system, which can be useful if the system contains many stars, which themselves may be designated B or C. (Stars get capital letters; planets receive lowercase designations.) If a bunch of exoplanets around the same star are found at once, the planet closest to its star is named b with more distant planets named c, d, e and so on.
An example of an exoplanet name is Kepler-16b, where "Kepler" is the name of the telescope that observed the system, 16 is the order in which the star was cataloged and "b" is the closest planet to the star. If we were naming Earth as an exoplanet, it would be called Sun d (Sun is the name of our star, and Earth is the third planet, starting with b, Mercury).

Strange New Worlds
Explore intriguing worlds in our galaxy
The first planets beyond our solar system, exoplanets, were discovered in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since then, we've discovered thousands more. Here are a few of our favorites.
Kepler-16b - 1 planet, 2 stars
Discovered 2011: Kepler-16b is a world where two suns set over the horizon instead of just one, the first Tatooine-like planet found in our galaxy.
Kepler-22b - Possible water world
Discovered 2011: A possible ocean world orbiting in the habitable zone—the region around a star where the temperature is right for liquid water, a requirement for life on Earth.
Kepler-7b - First to be cloud-mapped
Discovered 2009: A massive world called a hot Jupiter, Kepler-7b was the first exoplanet to have its clouds mapped.
Kepler-452 b - Earth's older cousin
Discovered 2015: An "Earth-cousin" that orbits a star like our sun in the habitable zone, where liquid water could exist.
KELT-9 b - Hotter than most stars
Discovered 2017: KELT-9b is so hot that the heat tears molecules apart on the dayside.
WASP-12 b - Being eaten by parent star
Discovered 2008: The doomed planet WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter that orbits so close to its parent star, it's being torn apart. It takes this alien world only 1.1 days to completely circle its Sun.
55 Cancri e - Lava ocean, sparkling skies
Discovered 2004: This super hot world is covered in a global ocean of lava and has sparkling skies.
TYC 8998-760-1 b - Planet or failed star?
Discovered 2020: This object, a brown dwarf or perhaps a large planet, joins an exclusive club: those that have been directly imaged.
GJ 15 A b - Super-heated Super-Earth
Discovered 2014: GJ 15 A b orbits a red-dwarf star just 11 light-years away with its companion GJ 15 A c, making them our nearest multi-planet neighbors discovered so far.
GJ 15 A c - Only 11 light-years away
Discovered 2018: Nearby GJ 15 A c orbits a red-dwarf star just 11 light-years away with its companion, making them our nearest multi-planet neighbors discovered so far.
Kepler-36 b - Bizarrely close neighbors
Discovered 2012: Kepler-36b and its companion planet, Kepler-36c, are far too close to their sun to be in the habitable zone, and they are bizarrely close to each other.
GJ 504 b - Magnificently magenta
If we could travel to this giant planet, we would see a world still glowing from the heat of its formation with a color reminiscent of a dark cherry blossom, a dull magenta.
GJ 436 b - Mysteriously missing methane
Discovered 2004: A close exoplanet with a secret: a lack of methane on this hot world. GJ 436 b is a Neptune-sized exoplanet that orbits an M-type star. Its mass is 22.1 Earths
TOI-849 b - Atmosphere destroyed by star
Discovered 2020: A world called TOI 849 b could be the exposed, naked core of a gas giant whose atmosphere was blasted away by its star.
AU Microscopii b - Infant solar system
Discovered 2020: Located less than 32 light-years from Earth, AU Microscopii is among the youngest planetary systems ever observed by astronomers, and its star throws vicious temper tantrums!
PSR B1257+12 b - Doomed world
Discovered 1994: PSR B1257+12 b, along with fellow doomed worlds, were among the first and creepiest to be discovered as they orbit an undead star known as a pulsar. Pulsar planets like Poltergeist and its neighboring worlds, Phobetor and Draugr, are consumed with constant radiation from the star’s core.
HD 189733 b - Rains glass
Discovered 2005: This far-off blue planet may look like a friendly haven – but don’t be deceived! Weather here is deadly. The planet’s cobalt blue color comes from a hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing clouds laced with glass. Howling winds send the storming glass sideways at 5,400 mph (2km/s), whipping all in a sickening spiral. It’s death by a million cuts on this slasher planet!
KOI-55 b - Hotter than the Sun
Discovered 2011: Kepler-70b (aka KOI-55) could well be another circle of hell with an average temperature hotter than the Sun’s surface. It used to be Jupiter-sized until it spent some time inside its now-dead star…a trip that destroys most planets, but left this one a Freddy Krueger-like burned world smaller than Earth. At about 12,000 degrees F (6,800 C), it is one of the hottest planets discovered. In fact, the planet itself is evaporating, soon to be another victim.
D 17156 b - AKA Mulchatna
Discovered 2007: A giant planet composed mostly of gas. Also given the name Mulchatna, for a river in Alaska that supports indigenous and native populations.
GJ 1132 b - On its second atmosphere
Discovered 2015: GJ 1132 b may have begun as a mini-Neptune, but is now a rocky world a little bigger than Earth. The planet may have lost one atmosphere but gained another from volcanic activity.
TIC 172900988 b - Rare double transit discovery
Discovered 2021: This planet about as big around as Jupiter belongs to a system that’s a stunner. The planet orbits two stars and, viewed from Earth, crosses the faces of both. That means this system puts on quite a show!
WASP-96 b - Hot and puffy with a signature of water
Discovered 2014: An international team found that WASP-96 b is a world with a sodium rich atmosphere. The planet, located nearly 1,150 light-years from Earth, orbits its star every 3.4 days. It has about half the mass of Jupiter, and its discovery was announced in 2014.
TOI-3757 b - Marshmallow planet
Discovered 2022: A gas giant exoplanet with the density of a marshmallow has been detected in orbit around a cool red dwarf. TOI-3757 b, is the lowest-density planet ever detected around a red dwarf star (2022).
TrES-2 b - Eternal Night
Are you afraid of the dark? Welcome to TrEs-2b, the planet of eternal night. The darkest planet ever discovered orbiting a star, this alien world is less reflective than coal. Inside its atmosphere, you’d be flying blind in the dark. Some scientists think an eerie deep red glow would emanate from its burning atmosphere.
Glossary
Sometimes the terms used to describe the planets beyond our solar system need more explanation. Below are some of the more common words and phrases you might run across.
Exoplanet:
A planet orbiting a star other than our Sun; also called “extrasolar planet.”
Habitable zone:
The range of orbital distance from a star at which temperatures would allow liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet with sufficient atmosphere. This range of distance changes depending on the size and temperature of the star. Earth is in the habitable zone of the Sun, one of the reasons our planet has liquid water like oceans and lakes.
Goldilocks zone:
An alternative name for “habitable zone” (see above), from the children’s story, “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.”
Terrestrial:
Planets composed mostly of rock (silicates) and metals, like Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury. Sometimes also called “rocky” or “telluric.”
Tidally locked:
When a celestial body, such as a planet or moon, always has one side facing the body it orbits, such as a star or planet. A tidally-locked planet has a day side facing the heat of its star, and a colder night side facing away. Tidal forces and the star’s gravity “lock” the planet, so that its orbital period is equal to its rotation period.
Red dwarf star or M dwarf star:
A class of small, relatively cool stars, emitting dim, red light. They are the most common type of star, comprising about 75 percent of all stars in the galaxy.
Light-year:
The distance light travels in one year, about 5.88 trillion miles (about 9.5 trillion kilometers).
AU:
An astronomical unit – the distance between Earth and the Sun, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
Super-Earth:
One of the most common types of exoplanets discovered so far, with a mass between that of Earth and Neptune. The properties of such planets are largely unknown.
Orbit:
The curving, repeating path of an object, such as a satellite, moon or planet, around a space body such as a moon, planet or star.
Infrared:
Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than the red end of the visible light spectrum, but shorter than microwaves.
Transit:
When an exoplanet crosses the face of its star from the perspective of Earthbound observers. The change in brightness of the star due to the exoplanet can be measured and used to calculate the diameter of the exoplanet.
James Webb Space Telescope:
This NASA space telescope, which launched in 2021, is a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror. It is the most powerful and complex space science telescope ever built. It is sometimes called JWST or Webb.
Spitzer Space Telescope:
A NASA space telescope launched in August 2003 and retired in January 2020. Spitzer observed infrared (heat) radiation from exoplanets, stars, stellar nurseries, the centers of galaxies and the early stages of planetary system formation.
Light curve:
Graphical representation of changes in the brightness of space objects over time, including those of variable stars, supernovae and transiting exoplanets that sometimes pass in front of their stars.
Hot Jupiter:
A giant, gas planet in extremely close orbit around its star. Some complete a single orbit—their “year”—in as little as a few Earth days.
Water World:
Hypothesized extrasolar planets with surfaces completely covered by deep oceans of water.
Radial Velocity:
The amount of “wobble” induced in a star by the gravity of an orbiting planet, or planets. By measuring the stretching and compressing of light wavelengths from the star, as it is pulled in one direction, then another, Earthbound observers can detect extrasolar planets.
Mass:
The mass of a planet is the amount of matter in the planet, which is not always the same as its “size.” Exoplanet masses are measured in comparison to Earth for smaller rocky planets, or Jupiter for big gas planets. The standard unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), and the Earth’s mass is about 5.97 x 1024 kg.
Brown dwarf:
A star-like object that is not quite massive enough to burn like a star, but bigger than a planet.
Ultra-cool dwarf:
Star-like objects with effective temperatures of less than 2,700 Kelvin are referred to as
‘ultracool dwarfs.' This group includes stars with extremely low mass and brown dwarfs, or objects that are not quite massive enough to burn like a star. “Dwarf” is the term for an average adult star, used to distinguish stars like the sun from the giant stars that exist in the universe.
Spectroscopy:
A method of analyzing light by separating it into distinct wavelengths, which allows one to identify its chemical components (by their unique wavelength signatures) to determine the atmospheric components of alien worlds.
White dwarf:
A dim, dense, compact star; the remnant core that remains after intermediate-mass stars (similar to the Sun) exhaust their nuclear fuel and blow off their outer layers. They are dominated by oxygen and carbon, but often have thin layers of hydrogen and helium.
F-type star:
A main sequence star that is somewhat hotter, more massive, and more luminous than our Sun.
General questions
What is an exoplanet?
An exoplanet is a planet outside our solar system, usually orbiting another star. They are also sometimes called "extrasolar planets," "extra-" implying that they are outside of our solar system.
detailed answer
Is there life on other planets?
Earth is the only planet we know of with life on it...so far. Scientists are searching the galaxy for planets similar to Earth, and signs of life. As we see on Earth, life can adapt to conditions that human beings would consider very harsh (temperature, radiation, salinity, acidity, aridity, etc). So it may be possible that life started on other worlds and adapted to conditions quite alien to what we are used to.
detailed answer
How many exoplanets are there?
To date, more than 5,500 exoplanets have been discovered and are considered "confirmed" by NASA, out of the billions in our galaxy alone. There are thousands of other "candidate" exoplanet detections that require further observations in order to say for sure whether or not the exoplanet is real.
detailed answer
Where are exoplanets?
In a lot of places! Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within thousands of light years of the solar system). That is as far as current telescopes have been able to probe.
detailed answer
What is the closest exoplanet to Earth?
Proxima Centauri b, which is about four light-years away. Its mass is consistent with it being slightly larger than Earth. Based on what we know about exoplanets, and planets in our solar system similar in mass to Earth, it is most likely a rocky planet. Proxima Centauri b orbits in the "habitable zone" of its star, which means it could have liquid water on its surface – if it has an atmosphere which could support it. Calculations suggest that the one side of the exoplanet Proxima b faces its star all the time, which would make for a very different atmosphere and weather than we have on Earth. Its parent star, Proxima Centauri, is a dim red dwarf star that gives off about 600 times less light than our Sun. Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Earth after our Sun, but it is still about 9,000 times farther than planet Neptune.
How do we find exoplanets?
The successes of discovering exoplanets in recent decades seem to be telling us that the galaxy is teeming with trillions of exoplanets, but finding them isn't easy. Planets are typically billions of times fainter than the stars they orbit, and they are incredibly distant. The challenges of observing extrasolar planets stem from four basic facts: Planets don't produce any light of their own, except when they’re recently formed (i.e. young). They are an enormous distance from us. They are lost in the blinding glare of their parent stars. Their sizes and masses are typically much, much smaller than that of the stars they orbit.It’s pretty rare for astronomers to see an exoplanet through their telescopes the way you might see Mars through a telescope from Earth. That’s called direct imaging, and only a handful of exoplanets have been found this way (and these tend to be young gas giant planets orbiting very far from their stars).Most exoplanets are found through indirect methods: measuring the dimming of a star that happens to have a planet pass in front of it, or monitoring the spectrum of a star for the tell-tale signs of a planet pulling on its star and causing its light to subtly Doppler shift. NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope finds thousands of planets by observing “transits,” the slight dimming of light from a star when its tiny planet passes between it and our telescopes. Other methods include gravitational lensing, the “wobble method,” and direct imaging.
Will a person ever go to an exoplanet?
Not anytime soon, given the enormous distances between the stars and the time it would take to travel between them with our current technology. Perhaps one day a robot will visit an exoplanet like the rovers on Mars. But that day too is still very far in the future. First, we have to learn how to travel much faster and further in space than we’ve ever gone before. Keeping humans alive to complete such a long journey is probably the biggest challenge. Today, NASA is concentrating on the steps to get humans to Mars, which is our next-door neighbor. In the meantime, you can “stand” on an illustration of an exoplanet surface with our virtual reality.
Will we ever take real images of exoplanets?
Yes! In recent years, NASA has taken images, called direct imaging, of exoplanets that are light-years away. In the images, the planets sometimes look like faint spots next to blotted out regions (where the bright light of the planet's star has been subtracted). Examples of imaged planets orbit the bright stars Fomalhaut, HR 8799, and Beta Pictoris. The James Webb Space Telescope and upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will image more exoplanets around nearby stars. The big challenge for NASA is to image Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars, which tend to be about 10 billion times fainter than their stars,
How many telescopes are looking for exoplanets?
There are telescopes in space, on the ground and even in the air that are being used to hunt exoplanets. NASA has telescopes in space currently studying exoplanets – one observatory dedicated to discovering exoplanets (the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), and Hubble, a powerful, general-purpose observatory that conduct a wide range of astronomical observations, including exoplanet science. The James Webb Space Telescope is exploring exoplanet atmospheres. More than two dozen telescopes on the ground are being used to discover and characterize exoplanets, ranging from small robotic observatories to large telescopes like the Keck Observatories in Hawaii. Even SOFIA, NASA's infrared observatory built into a Boeing 747-SP airplane, conducted some exoplanet observations.
Do any exoplanets have rings?
Rings orbit all of the gas giant planets in our solar system. They range from being very dusty (Jupiter), to very icy (Saturn), to very carbon-rich (Uranus and Neptune). This hints that rings may be common around cold gas giant exoplanets orbiting other stars too. A very large ring system has been detected around one candidate exoplanet, J1407 b; however the rings cover tens of millions of miles. It may be a disk of material forming exomoons rather than ring system similar to Saturn's.
Do exoplanets have water on them?
Scientists have found water molecules in the atmospheres of several exoplanets, but some of those planets are very hot and probably not suitable for life as we know it. Scientists have yet to discover liquid water, like oceans or lakes. They are looking for exoplanets with liquid water in an area called the “habitable zone” around stars.
What is the habitable zone or “Goldilocks zone”?
The habitable zone is the area around a star where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of surrounding planets.
detailed answer
What are exoplanets made of?
The exoplanets for which astronomers are able to measure both their sizes (diameters) and masses, have densities that are suggestive of compositions ranging from very rocky (like Earth and Venus) to very gas-rich (like Jupiter and Saturn). Exoplanets are made up of elements similar to that of the planets in our solar system, but their mixes of those elements may differ. Some planets may be dominated by water or ice, while others are dominated by iron or carbon.
Are there any exoplanets like Earth?
Not yet. We haven’t found a planet that can support life like Earth. So far, our home is unique in the universe. We have found many Earth-sized rocky exoplanets, some of which are in the habitable zones of their stars. The next step in studying them is to analyze their atmospheres for “biosignature" molecules, which may be a sign of life.
Are other solar systems like ours?
Other solar systems, called planetary systems, come in many shapes and sizes. When scientists first started searching for planetary systems, they expected them to look like our solar system, with inner rocky planets and outer cold gas giants and ice planets. But some solar systems pack many planets into very compact orbits with short orbital periods, while others have only a few planets with orbits that last hundreds of years. Some planetary systems have Jupiter-like giants that orbit their star in a few hours, and are hot enough to melt metal. Some exoplanets even orbit multiple stars at a time.(Note: “Dwarf” is actually the name for a regular-sized adult star, distinguishing them from giant stars. An example of a giant star is Rigel, the blue supergiant found in the constellation Orion).
Do exoplanets have stars like our Sun?
Yes, some do. Kepler-452b is an example of a planet that orbits a star like our sun. Both our sun and Kepler-452 are G dwarf stars, which make up only 3 percent of the stars in the universe. More common are M dwarf stars– small red stars that make up 75 percent of all the stars we know.Other stars in our universe range from massive and hot O-type stars to the small and cool M dwarf stars like TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima Centauri. Scientists have found planets around five star types that range from red, to orange, to bluish-white. Some planets even orbit two or three stars at a time.(Note: “Dwarf” is actually the name for a regular-sized adult star, distinguishing them from giant stars. An example of a giant star is Rigel, the blue supergiant found in the constellation Orion).
How do exoplanets get their names?
Exoplanet names can look long and complicated at first, but they have a logic behind them that is important to scientists cataloging thousands of planets. Let’s use HD 189733 b (a blue-ish planet where it may rain glass sideways) as an example. The first part of the name is usually the telescope or survey that found it. In this case "HD" stands for the "Henry Draper Catalogue,” a widely-used star catalog. The number 189733 is the order in which the star was catalogued by position (the 189,733rd star added to the catalog). The lowercase letter "b" stands for the planet, in the order in which the planet was found. The first planet found is always named b, with ensuing planets named c, d, e, f and so on.
detailed answer
What is a light-year?
The distance light travels in one year. Light zips through space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, or 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers) a year.
